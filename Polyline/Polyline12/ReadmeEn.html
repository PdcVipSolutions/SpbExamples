<h1><strong>Polyline 12 Projects Family </strong></h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The demonstration of practices of the Vip-based programming:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solving the problem of the call stack overloading in the endless deep recursion.<br />  
  The Release 11 projects family had the problem - the overloading of the call stack on some values of the multiplication <strong>TheSizeOfTheBoard*AmountOfRounds</strong> and appropriate  breakdown of the application.<br />
  The purpose of the Release 12 is to solve this problem.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The set of projects</strong><br />
    The set of project in Release 12 differs from the set of projects of the Release11:
    <ul>
      <li>Release 12 doesn't contain projects <strong>Console, ConsoleLib, ObjectConsole, ObjectConsoleLib</strong>;</li>
      <li>Project
ObjectWin contains three variants ObjectWin0, ObjectWin1, ObjectWin2 .
These variants show the phases of the modification of the code;</li>
      <li>Projects ObjectWinLibX corrspond to projects ObjectWinX, but HumanInterface represented as the library; </li>
      <li>The
project ObjectConsole contains the only final solutions. The purpose of
the project ObjectConsole is testing and compatibility check. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The new test model</strong> of the Player Computer00 added<br />
The only purpose of the creation of the model of the player Computer00
is to simulate the behavior of the application on the large amount of
moves, which players make.</li>
</ul>

    <tr>
      <td>ObjectWin0/Polyline12_ObjWindows</td>
      <td><p>The
code of the class SeniourJudge is modified to make it clear the of the
interaction of players and the class JuniourJudge. The player model
Computer00 added. The Player Computer00 makes always the same special
move. The class JuniourJudge recognizes this special move, doesn't show
it on the board and informs the SeniourJudge about move occurrence.
Thus the next move may be done. The maximal amount of moves is defined
by the constant <strong>playLimit_C</strong> in the class JuniourJudge. The problem appears when <strong>playLimit_C</strong>=10000.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ObjectWin1/Polyline12_ObjWindows</td>
      <td>The
first step of the modification of the code to solve the problem. The
recursive mechanism of the organization of moves is replaced by the
iterative mechanism. The application works stable when <strong>playLimit_C</strong>=100000. The multigame mode  and the interruption process is not modified correctly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ObjectWin2/Polyline12_ObjWindows</td>
      <td>The final version. All modes can run correctly. Test player Computer00 can play, when <strong>playLimit_C</strong>=100000.</td>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>  The behavior  of applications of the Release 12 is the same as the behavior  of applications of the Release 11 </li>
  <li>The new test model of the Player Computer00 added (endless moves simulator). <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Build  notes </h2>
<p>Please, see first <a href="VersionReference.html">your version speciality</a></p>
<p>Open and build projects:</p>
<ul><li>Programs\ObjectWin0\Polyline12_ObjWindows0.vipprj</li>
  <li>Programs\ObjectWin1\Polyline12_ObjWindows1.vipprj</li>
  <li>ProgramsDir\ObjectWin2\Polyline12_ObjWindows2.vipprj</li>
</ul>
<p>Run command file Programs\<strong>BuildHumanInterfaceLib.cmd</strong></p>
<p>Open and build projects (if needed):</p>
<ul><li>Programs\ObjectWinLib0\Polyline12_ObjWindows0.vipprj</li>
  <li>Programs\ObjectWinLib1\Polyline12_ObjWindows1.vipprj</li>
  <li>Programs\ObjectWinLib2\Polyline12_ObjWindows2.vipprj</li>
</ul>
<p>To build projects of the Polyline12 release  the IDE variable <strong>SpbSolutions</strong> must be set to the <strong>SpbVipTools</strong> directory.</p><h2>Run notes </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Player Computer00 may be involved as the single player and must be assigned as the Starter.</li>
  <li>The language of the application may be defined in the  command line by the language indentifier:
    <ul>
      <li> en - English</li>
      <li> ru - Russian</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When running the program from the IDE, the parameter  of the language must be placed to the field <strong>Project Settings\Run  Options\Run Arguments</strong>, available from menu <strong>Project\Settings...</strong></li>
</ul>
