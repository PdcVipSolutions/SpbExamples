<h1>Polyline Project Evolutions</h1>
<p><strong>Copyright (c) Victor Yukhtenko </strong></p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p> This is an example of the evolution of the project development. A very easy game
has been chosen as the basic idea. We do not know the initial name of
this game so we call it Polyline.</p>
<p>Each development step represented as the release, so you can see
step by step the evolution of the application. Each release expands the
functionality of the application, moving along the way the code is
extended, modified and restructured or only restructured and modified. </p>
<p>Looking carefully on the code of each release you can see technique
of the using of the Visual Prolog and advanced tools. It can be used to
study the Visual Prolog features. </p>
<h2>Game description</h2>
<p> The game is played on an M x N board. </p>
<p>Game rules</p>
<ul>
  <li> Each player on his turn adds a new point. The point must
prolong the existing Polyline (or start the Polyline, if it doesn't
exist) in the vertical or hirisontal direction only.</li>
  <li> The resulting Polyline must be non-interrupted and each move can be taken at any of end of the line.</li>
  <li> The player, which locks the line (the point is set on the polyline), wins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<p>To build and study projects of series you must  install Visual Prolog programming system.</p>
<p>The reference information regarding the features depending on the
vesrion of the Visual Prolog&nbsp; please see
in the file <a href="VersionReference.html">VersionReference.html</a>.</p>
<p>Short information regarding each release may be found in the table below.</p>

<h2>Building notes </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Releases 1-9 projects may be built one by one without any tricks.</li>
  <li>Since Release 10 all projects use <strong>SpbSolutions</strong> IDE variable, which must refere to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SpbVipTools</span> directory.</li>
  <li>Since Release 11 some projects demonstrate building libraries, thuse user must have <strong>Microsoft lib.exe</strong> program tool (see details in the release appropriate <strong>Readme.htm</strong> file). </li>
  <li>Projects
placed to the Release 14 (Polyline14) PzlBasedApplicaions folder need
to run the registration procedure after buiding all projects placed to
the <strong>Containers</strong> directory. This must be done using the Programs\pzlBasedApplication\<strong>RegisterComponents.cmd</strong> command file.</li>
  <li>Some
Projects since Release 12 demonstrate and use the DLL creation. So
these projects must be built using VIP CE only (please see details the
file <a href="VersionReference.html">VersionReference.html</a>).</li>
  <li>All Polyline-related projects create the executable programs at Polyline\Execute folder.<br /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Comments to Releases </h2>

</ul>
<h3><a name="8" id="8"></a>Release 8 (Project PolyLine8) </h3>
<p>Code reorganized. Each class now placed in the separate package</p>
<h3><a name="9" id="9"></a>Release 9 (Project PolyLine9)</h3>
<p>Code reorganized. Each class is dynamic class, which generates the object.</p>
<h3> <a name="10" id="10"></a>Release 10 (Project PolyLine10) </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Multi Game mode now can be repeated</li>
  <li> Code reorganized. Communication with Players based now on events.</li>
  <li> The Polyline10 Project uses the NotificationAgency Package, which is a part of  the SpbVipTools.</li>
  <li> To build the Polyline10 project you must define the IDE valriable SpbSolutions as the path to the&nbsp;SpbVipTools directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="11" id="11"></a>Release 11 (Folder PolyLine11) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Release 11 is the set of projects, which has the same game
logic organization, but differs by the User Interface type - &#1057;&#1086;nsole ,
ObjectConsole, Windows. <br />
    the use of VIP-based libraries</li>
  <li> Some components are represented same time as the source code (.PRO) and as the libraries (.LIB).</li>
</ul>
<p> See more <a href="Polyline11/ReadmeEn.html">details at ...</a> </p>
<h3><a name="12" id="12"></a>Release 12 (Folder PolyLine12)</h3>
<p> The Release 11 projects family had the problem - the overloading of
the call stack on some values of the multiplication
TheSizeOfTheBoard*AmountOfRounds and appropriate breakdown of the
application.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Release 12 is to solve this problem. </p>
<h5>The set of projects</h5>
<p>  The set of project in Release 12 differs from the set of projects of the Release11:</p>
<ul>
  <li> First, Release 12 doesn't contain Console-based projects.</li>
  <li> Second, project ObjectWin contains now three
variants ObjectWin0, ObjectWin1, ObjectWin2 and Projects ObjectWinLibX,
where the UI is presented as the library. These variants show the
phases of the modification of the code. </li>
  
</ul>
<h5><strong> Functionality</strong></h5>
<ul>
  <li> The behavior of applications of the Release 12 is the same as the behavior of applicaons of the Release 11</li>
  <li>
The new test model of the Player Computer00 added. The only purpose of
the creation of the model of the player Computer00 is to simulate the
behavior of the application on the large amount of moves, which players
make.</li>
</ul> See more <a href="Polyline12/ReadmeEn.html">details at ...</a>
<h3> <a name="13" id="13"></a>Release 13 (Folder PolyLine13) </h3>
<h5>The set of projects</h5>
<p> The Release 13 contains the set of strongly dependent projects -
the project of the main application and projects of three DLLs, where
DLL has the special project to build it.</p>
<p> The set of projects contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The Project ModelsDLL (generates the DLL), where models of
the computer strategies of the game Computer0, Computer1, Computer2 are
placed.</li>
  <li> The Project Computer3DLL (generates the DLL), where the model of the strategy Computer3 is placed.</li>
  <li>
The Project HumanInterfaceDLL (generates the DLL), where classes
related to the HumanInterface are placed. This DLL is called using the
library, which used while building the main application. </li>
  <li>The Project Polyline13_ObjWindows - the project of the main executable application</li>
  <li> The same functionality</li>
</ul>
<h5>Functionality </h5>
<p>The behavior of applications of the Release 13 is the same as the
behavior of applications of the Release 11, 12. The only difference is
the DLL-related violations exceptions reacting.</p><p> See more <a href="Polyline13/ReadmeEn.html">details at ...</a></p>
<h3> <a name="14" id="14"></a>Release 14 (Folder PolyLine14) </h3>
<h5>The set of projects</h5>
<p>The Release 14 contains the set of projects, which demonstrates the
different phases of the transformation of the application Polyline
Release 13 to the application based on the Pzl-Technology (see
http://wiki.visual-prolog.com/index.php?title=Category:VpPuZzle).</p>
<p>  The set of projects contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The Project MonoApplicaion\Polyline14_ObjWindows_Mono.vipprj shows how classes are converted to pzl-Components.</li>
  <li>
The Project MonoApplicaionLib\Polyline14_ObjWindowsLib.vipprj is the same project as
MonoApplicaion\Polyline14_ObjWindows_Mono.vipprj, where HumanInterface and player Computer3
represented as the libraries.</li>
  <li> The directory
pzlBasedApplication contains again the set of projects - the main
application Polyline14_ObjWindowsPzl.vipprj and the set of projects, where each project
corresponds to the pzlContainer, where basic components of the
application are placed.</li>
</ul>
<h5> Functionality</h5>
<p> The behavior of applications of the Release 14 is the same.</p><p> See more <a href="Polyline14/ReadmeEn.html">details at ...</a></p>
