This is an example of the evolution of the project development beginning from the initial idea till the today status.
The very easy game have been chosen as the basic idea. We do not know the initial name of this game thus we call it Polyline.

Each release expands the functionality of the application. Moving along this way the code is modified and restructured or the only code is restructured and modified.

'''Game description'''
:It is shown the flat playing field. The dimension of the field is M x N.

''Game rules''
:Each player on his turn adds the new point.  This point must prolong  the existing Polyline  (or start the Polyline, if it doesn't exist). 
:The resulting  Polyline must be non interrupted and each move can be done using  any of  end of the line. 
:The player, which locks the  line (the point is set on the polyline), wins.
