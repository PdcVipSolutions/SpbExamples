<h1>Release 11</h1>
<p><strong>Copyright (c) Victor Yukhtenko </strong></p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>To demonstrate the basic approaches of the VIP-based  programming:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The difference in the traditional Console and object-oriented  approach (ObjectConsole* and GUI).</li>
  <li>The strong separation of the User Interface and  logical part </li>
  <li>Creation of Vip-based libraries</li>
</ul>*The ObjectConsole - &nbsp;it is just the tutorial joke.
<h2>Code</h2>
<h3>User interfaces</h3>
<p> Release 11 is the set of projects, which has the same game logic
organization, but differs by the User Interface type - &#1057;&#1086;nsole,
ObjectConsole, Windows.</p>
<h3>The use of VIP-based libraries</h3>
<p>Some components are represented same time as the source code (.PRO)
and as the libraries (.LIB). Alternative projects presented in the
Release 11. The text of the appropriate .CMD file to build libraries
also presented.</p>
<p>To build libraries the application '''lib'''  (Microsoft Linker Stub 7.10.3077) has been used.</p>
<h3>Logic and UI strongly separated</h3>
<p> In all projects of the Release 11 the code, representing the logic
and the code representing the User Interface are strongly separated. </p>
<p>All Projects of the Release 11 family use the common set of classes,
which supports the logic of the game, configuration settings and the
game managing.<br />
  &nbsp;<br /> The same time each project uses
its own concept of the User Interface. It makes the possibility to
create other user interface implementations and to use other UI
concepts based say on HTML or XML. It is possible even to use other
programming languages to create User Interface.</p>
<h3>Some hints on the universality</h3>
<p> The structure of the code of the common used logical part gives the
possibility to use the logical part with no change to organize the set
of similar flat games. The only one JuniourJudge module must be
replaced by the module with the same class name and interface and with
the new rules support.</p>
<p>The new concepts of models of players must be created  accordingly.</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Different UserInterfaces (Console, Object Console, GUI) with the same game logic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known problems</h2>
<p> The Release 11 set of projects has been grown on the basis of
Release 10 project. The interaction between players is organized as the
hidden (deeply recursive) process, where the tail recursion demand is
not fulfilled. </p>
<p>Because of this reason after some value of the multiplication
&lt;board size&gt;*&lt;amount of games in the serial games&gt; the call
stack is overloaded and the application disappears. </p>
<p>This problem is fixed  in the release 12.</p>
<h2>Build  notes </h2>
<p>Please, see first <a href="VersionReference.html">your version speciality</a></p>
<p>Open and build projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Polyline11_Console - console application</li>
  <li>Polyline11_ObjectConsole object-oriented console</li>
  <li>Polyline11_ObjWindows - Windows PFC/GUI</li>
</ul>
<p>Run command file Programs\<strong>BuildHumanInterfaceLib.cmd</strong></p>
<p>Open and build projects:</p>
<ul><li>Polyline11_ConsoleLib - the same but the User  Interface placed to the library</li>
  <li>  Polyline11_ObjectConsoleLib - the same but the User  Interface placed to the library</li>
  <li>  Polyline11_ObjWindowsLib - Windows PFC/GUI, the User  Interface placed to the library</li>
</ul>
<p>To build projects of the Polyline11 release  the IDE variable SpbSolutions must be set to the SpbVipTools directory.</p><h2>Run notes </h2>
<ul>
  <li>The language of the application may be defined in the  command line by the language indentifier:
    <ul>
      <li> en - English</li>
      <li> ru - Russian</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When running the program from the IDE, the parameter  of the language must be placed to the field <strong>Project Settings\Run  Options\Run Arguments</strong>, available from menu <strong>Project\Settings...</strong></li>
</ul>
